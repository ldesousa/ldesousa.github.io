	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	Luís Alexandre Duque Moreira de Sousa was born in Lisbon to a migrant working class family, soon after the revolution that re-instated Democracy in Portugal. Taking the opportunity of a short period when education was nearly free and open to all in this country, he was able to access University and complete a degree1 on Computer Science.  
	<br><br>
	His professional life has gravitated around research in one way or another, as a student, a teacher and as a scientist. Luís kept studying, completing an MSc in Geographic Information Systems and more recently a PhD on Computer Science. His competences are centred on GeoInformatics, presently exclusively based on Open Source technologies.
