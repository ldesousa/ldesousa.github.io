	<h1>Luís Moreira de Sousa</h1>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	Luís Alexandre Duque Moreira de Sousa was born in Lisbon to a migrant working 
	class family, soon after the revolution that re-instated Democracy in Portugal. 
	Taking the opportunity of a short period when education was nearly free and open 
	to all in this country, he was able to access University and complete a degree on 
	Computer Science.
	<br><br>
	His professional life has gravitated around research in one way or another, 
	as a student, a teacher and as a scientist. Luís kept studying, completing an 
	MSc in Geographic Information Systems and more recently a PhD on Computer Science. 
	His competences are centred on GeoInformatics, presently exclusively based on 
	Open Source technologies.
