Resource Depletion
==================

During the summer of 2005 Luís started a Portuguese language web-site on Peak Oil ([PicoDoPetroleo.net](http://www.picodopetroleo.net/)) when faced with the wide apathy of local media and political class towards the subject. Later that year he was invited to start the Portuguese chapter of ASPO, becoming the developer and manager of its web-site ([ASPO-Portugal.com](http://www.aspo-portugal.com/))

In 2006 Luís started submitting research articles to [TheOilDrum](http://www.theoildrum.com), an electronic forum on energy depletion that would become the world reference in this field. During the Fall of 2006 he would publish his first article on World Oil Exports where he postulated that the volume of Oil traded internationally had entered a terminal decline, being this the utmost factor behind rising oil prices in recent years. By the end of that year Luís would integrate the team that started the [European chapter](http://europe.theoildrum.com) of TheOilDrum, thus becoming a permanent contributor to the forum, a role he still maintains.

Luís would deepen his work on Exports the following years. In October of 2008 we was an invited speaker to the ASPO Conference in Barcelona, where he presented a model encompassing 25 individual oil exporting nations, which produced essentially the same conclusions of the earlier assessment in 2006. Almost 5 years after his ground breaking observations there are now but a handful of countries in the world with real perspectives to increase oil exports; little doubt remains on the accuracy of his forecast.

Beyond Oil Exports, Luís' research has touched several subjects through the years, including the Olduvai Theory, macro-economic consequences of Petroleum depletion and Coal supplies. More recently he has focused on Energy Policy at the national and European scopes. He has been regularly invited to address the subject of fossil fuel depletion publicly and regularly collaborates with the local press on the economics of energy and metals.

Luís most recent writings on resource depletion can be found in the blog [AtTheEdgeOfTime](http://attheedgeoftime.blogspot.ch/search/label/energy).
