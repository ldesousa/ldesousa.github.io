Interests
=========

Life isn't just work, though some hobbies can be taken as serious as work. In May of 2005 the ASPO conference took place in Lisbon; though not attending, the knowledge Luís acquired in the following days made him realise life as he knew it was over. Since then most of his spare time has been dedicated to research on [resource depletion](depletion.md).


To balance the sedentary life of research, Luís rides his [bike](cycling.md) whenever possible, covering several thousands Km every year on the bumpy roads of Portugal.


[Music](music.md) is an old passion. No longer an active musician, Luís keeps on browsing the music universe as an avid listener.
